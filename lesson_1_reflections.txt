In my time as a server admin, I have never u
sed version control to work on scripts 
or programs like git. However, I have 
found myself having to compare, 
various version of scripts, configuraiton 
files, and pushing different versions of 
packages for various clients. In 
addition to helping me with my 
professional career, I know this will 
help me spot changes, and roll 
back should my changes not work well. 

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you 
a more effecient programmer in the long term?

A: Being able to recall specific verions, or rifle through old code snipets 
for quick reuse, or trial might be useful.
